## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment Note(I had an issue deploying the project on the platform, thats why I'm uploading it on the Github)

Due to cloud deployment timeouts, the dashboard may fail to deploy if:
- The dataset is large
- The initial chart rendering is slow
- The container does not respond quickly enough

This repo is intended to demonstrate the full functionality and design of the dashboard in Preview Mode.
